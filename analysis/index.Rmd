# Project overview

A single intracerebral ventricular injection of FGF1 induces permanent normalization of blood glucose levels in multiple rodent models of type 2 diabetes. To understand the effects of FGF1 and identify cell-type specific responses key to blood glucose normalization, we performed multiple high throughput transcriptomic analyses at different timepoints in cohorts of male ob/ob mice.
